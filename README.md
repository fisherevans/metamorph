# Metamorph

> Verb: to undergo a complete change of form, structure, or substance, as transformation by magic or witchcraft.

This project is the result of the countless times I've google search "base 64 decoder" and "json formatter" and pasting those outputs into sublime so I could find/replace stuff. And then doing that over and over while I debug issues.

So... I decided to make a little app that lets you configure a string of common transformations - and save them as a bookmark!

## Run it locally
